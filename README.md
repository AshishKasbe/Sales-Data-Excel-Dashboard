📊 Retail Store Sales Dashboard (Excel Project)

This is a simple yet complete Excel dashboard project I built to analyze retail sales data using Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and Slicers.
The goal was to understand key business metrics like revenue trends, top-performing products, customer patterns, and overall business performance — all shown on a clean, interactive dashboard.

🚀 Project Overview

This project takes raw sales data and turns it into a visual dashboard that helps answer questions like:

Which products generate the highest revenue?

How does monthly/quarterly sales performance look?

Which category or region performs the best?

Who are the top customers?

How does quantity sold compare across products?

Everything is managed through:

Pivot Tables

Pivot Charts

Slicers (for real-time filtering)

A dedicated dashboard sheet

🧰 Tools Used

Microsoft Excel

Pivot Tables

Pivot Charts

Slicers

Basic Excel functions

Data cleaning (sorting, formatting, removing inconsistencies)

📁 Project Structure

Inside the Excel file:

Raw Data Sheet – Original sales data

📊 Key Insights (from the dashboard)

Some of the insights you can extract from this dashboard:

Monthly revenue patterns

Best-selling products

Sales contribution by product category

This makes the dashboard interactive and useful for real-world decision-making.
